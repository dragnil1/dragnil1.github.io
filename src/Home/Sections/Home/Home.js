              I am a passionate researcher and software engineer, with a strong background in Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Software Development. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</a> in May 2023. My journey has since taken me into exciting fields of research and industry, where I continue to explore new challenges and innovations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I am a remote researcher at the Augmented Design Lab, University of California, Santa Cruz, where I work under the esteemed guidance of Professor <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~ejw/">Jim Whitehead</a>. My research is further supported by the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/abmalimalislam/home">A. B. M. Alim Al Islam</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/golam-md-muktadir/">Golam Muhammad Muktadir</a>, and <a href="https://jawadefaj.github.io/">Abdul Jawad</a>. In this role, I contribute to groundbreaking work in advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous vehicles, and robotics, focusing on creating safe and efficient AI systems that can operate seamlessly in dynamic real-world environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Parallel to my research, I work as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://therapbd.com/">Therap BD</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="https://www.therapservices.net/">Therap Services LLC</a>, where I engage in developing scalable, high-performance software solutions. My work here involves solving critical computational problems while adhering to the highest standards of clean, maintainable codeâ€”skills I also bring into my research endeavors.
            </p>
            <p>
            With expertise spanning across software engineering, autonomous driving technologies, and deep reinforcement learning, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what AI and machine learning can achieve in the realm of robotics and autonomous systems. My work is driven by curiosity, a strong problem-solving mindset, and a commitment to creating technology that can make a real-world impact.
